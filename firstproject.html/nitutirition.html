        <p>
            We should all aim to eat a healthy, varied diet based on the principles of the Eatwell Guide, and this is also the case 
            when you are active. When physically active, your body will use up more energy (calories). This can help with weight control or if 
            you are not looking to lose weight, you may find you need more food to replace the extra energy used. It is also important to
             keep well hydrated.

Eating well for physical activity and sport can have many benefits including:

allowing you to perform well in your chosen sport or activity
reducing the risk of injury and illness
ensuring the best recovery after exercise or a training programme
However, the dietary patterns that will best suit an individual will depend on the amount and intensity of activity. This can range from 
those who are just starting to get more active, those meeting the activity guidelines (of 150 minutes moderate activity per week),
 those who are active at higher levels (such as those training for an endurance event such as a marathon or doing organised team sports)
  or professional athletes. For professional athletes, getting personalised nutrition advice from a qualified sports nutritionist or
   dietitian is likely to be an important part of their training support.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical activity when losing weight</h3>
        <p>
            Doing physical activity will increase your energy expenditure (the calories you use), as energy is required during exercise to fuel the contracting muscles, increased breathing and heart rate and metabolism.

It is difficult to lose weight just by getting more active and it is still important to control your calorie intake for weight control. The most effective weight loss programmes include both a controlled diet and increased physical activity. It is also important to be active to keep weight off after weight loss. A study of people in the US who have successfully maintained their weight loss shows that they tend to be active for about an hour a day (usually walking) and spend less time in sedentary activities like watching TV in their free time.

The benefits of physical activity go beyond just burning off calories and can help preserve muscle as you lose weight and increase the proportion of muscle in the body. We also know that physical activity, and spending less time sitting, can reduce your risk of developing several chronic diseases, such as heart disease.
        </p>
        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>
            The main role of carbohydrates in physical activity is to provide energy. For athletes, if their diet does not contain enough carbohydrate, it is likely that their performance and recovery will be impaired, as carbohydrate is the key fuel for the brain and for muscles during exercise.

The body can store carbohydrates in the muscles and liver as glycogen and use these stores as a source of fuel for physical activity. These glycogen stores are limited, so for those training at a high level, it is important to be fully fuelled at the start of any exercise. Glycogen is the main source of energy at the start of exercise and during short bursts of exercise. If you are doing high intensity training for long periods and your glycogen stores are not sufficient you may feel tired, lack energy and not be able to perform at your best. So, regular intake of carbohydrate-rich foods can be important in this case to keep stores topped up. The correct food choices can help ensure the body has enough energy for activity, as well as help aid recovery.

Starchy foods are an important source of carbohydrates in our diet. Wholegrain varieties also provide fibre, and a range of vitamins and minerals including B vitamins, iron, calcium and folate. Sugars are also carbohydrates and the amount of ‘free sugars’ (those added to foods and drinks or in fruit juices, honeys and syrups) we consume should be limited. Find out more about this topic on our pages on starchy foods, sugar and fibre.
The amount of carbohydrate you need will depend on the frequency, type, duration and intensity of physical activity you do. Competitive sports people and athletes will likely require more carbohydrates than an average gym user to match the intensity of their activity level.   

If you are active at around the current recommended levels (150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of high intensity activity plus two sessions of muscle strengthening activities per week), then you can follow general healthy eating guidance to base meals on starchy carbohydrates, choosing wholegrain and higher fibre options where possible. For information about portion sizes of starchy foods you can use our Get portion wise! portion size guide.

At this level of activity, it is unlikely you will need to consume extra carbohydrates by eating more or by using products like sports drinks or other carbohydrate supplements, and these can be counterproductive if you are trying to control your weight as they will contribute extra calories. Sports drinks also contain sugars, which can damage teeth. Regardless of your level of activity, you should try not to meet your requirements by packing your entire carbohydrate intake into one meal. Spread out your intake over breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks that fit around planned exercise.

For athletes and individuals who are recreationally active to a higher level (such as training for a marathon), consuming additional carbohydrate may be beneficial for performance. Athletes can benefit from having some carbohydrate both before and after exercise to ensure adequate carbohydrate at the start of training and to replenish glycogen stores post exercise. In longer duration, high intensity exercise (60-90 minutes or more), such as a football match or a marathon, consuming some carbohydrate during exercise can also improve performance, for example in the form of a sports drink.

<h3>proteines</h3>
       <p>
        Protein is important in sports performance as it can boost glycogen storage, reduce muscle soreness and promote muscle repair. For those who are active regularly, there may be benefit from consuming a portion of protein at each mealtime and spreading protein intake out throughout the day.

        As some high protein foods can also be high in saturated fat, for example fatty meats or higher fat dairy products, it is important to choose lower fat options, such as lean meats. Most vegans get enough protein from their diets, but it is important to consume a variety of plant proteins to ensure enough essential amino acids are included. This is known as the complementary action of proteins. More information on vegetarian and vegan diets is available on our page on this topic.
        
        Whilst there may be a benefit in increasing protein intakes for athletes and those recreationally active to a high level, the importance of high protein diets is often overstated for the general population. It is a common misconception that high protein intakes alone increase muscle mass and focussing too much on eating lots of protein can mean not getting enough carbohydrate, which is a more efficient source of energy for exercise. It is important to note that high protein intakes can increase your energy (calorie) intake, which can lead to excess weight gain.
        The current protein recommendations for the general population are 0.75g of protein per kg of bodyweight per day for adults and most people are consuming more than this, so it’s unlikely that you need to eat extra protein if doing activity within the current guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. If you are participating in regular sport and exercise like training for a running or cycling event or lifting weights regularly, then your protein requirements may be slightly higher than the general sedentary population, to promote muscle tissue growth and repair.

        For strength and endurance athletes, protein requirements are increased to around 1.2-2.0g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day. The most recent recommendations for athletes from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) also focus on protein timing, not just total intake, ensuring high quality protein is consumed throughout the day (after key exercise sessions and around every 3–5 hours over multiple meals, depending on requirements). In athletes that are in energy deficit, such as team sport players trying to lose weight gained in the off season, there may be a benefit in consuming protein amounts at the high end, or slightly higher, than the recommendations, to reduce the loss of muscle mass during weight loss.
        
        Timing of protein consumption is important in the recovery period after training for athletes. Between 30 minutes and 2 hours after training, it is recommended to consume 15-25g of protein alongside some carbohydrate. Although they may be useful for convenient protein intakes around exercise, protein supplements cannot provide all the different components found in protein-rich foods so focussing on a ‘food first’ approach is optimal. A whey protein shake contains around 20g of protein, which you can get from half a chicken breast or a small can of tuna. For more information on protein supplements, see the supplements section. </p> 
<h3>Vegetarian and vegan diets for athletes</h3>
<p>
    There has been a rise in media interest around the use of vegetarian or vegan diets to improve sporting performance, however, this remains a new area for research and there have only been a few studies that have looked at vegan/vegetarian diets for athletes.

To date, there is no clear evidence to suggest that vegetarian or vegan diets impact performance differently to a mixed diet, although it is important to recognise that whatever the dietary pattern chosen, it is important to follow a diet that is balanced to meet nutrient requirements. More research is needed, to determine whether vegetarian or vegan diets can help athletic performance.

For the general population, while you do not have to cut out meat or dairy to have a healthy diet, eating a more plant-based diet, provided it’s healthy and varied, has the potential to benefit health. More plant-based diets can provide a wide variety of nutrients and natural phytochemicals, plenty of fibre and tend to be low in saturated fat, salt and sugar. More information on vegetarian and vegan diets is available on our page on this topic.

<h3>Fat</h3>
<p>
    Fat is essential for the body in small amounts, but it is also high in calories. Consuming too much fat can lead to excess calorie intake which can lead to weight gain over time, so this is a particular concern if you’re trying to control your weight. The type of fat consumed is also important. Studies have shown that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet can reduce blood cholesterol, which can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Fat-rich foods usually contain a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids but choosing foods that contain higher amounts of unsaturated fat and less saturated fat, is preferable as most of us eat too much saturated fat. Find more information on fat on our pages on this nutrient.

With relation to athletic performance, whilst there is ongoing research and increased media attention into the effects of higher fat/lower carbohydrate diets on performance, for the general population, the advice would be to stick to the population guidelines stated above.

If I am doing endurance training, should I be following low carbohydrate, high fat diets?

Carbohydrate is important as an energy source during exercise. Having very low intakes of carbohydrate when exercising can cause low energy levels, loss of concentration, dizziness or irritability.

Because carbohydrate is important for providing energy during exercise, there is a benefit in ensuring enough is consumed. This is especially for high-intensity exercise where some studies have shown that performance is reduced when carbohydrate intakes are low. Some studies in specific exercise scenarios such as lower intensity training in endurance runners, have found beneficial effects of low carbohydrate diets on performance. However, these results have not been consistent and so at the moment we do not have enough evidence to show that low-carbohydrate diets can benefit athletic performance.
